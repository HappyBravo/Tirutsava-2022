You got to know about <strong>the village hidden in the leaves</strong>, the home of <strong>Naruto</strong> is in danger. <strong>Orochimaru</strong>, the evil ninja, has attacked it and captured the entire village.</p>

<p>You are Naruto's friend, so you decided that you will help him <strong>no matter what</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-assets/0/1642399933-42df5df37f-leaf.jpg" alt="image" title=""></p>

<p>So you started your journey and gathered some information about naruto. You found out that he and his friends are being captive in a cave near the village hidden in the sand, but the cave is protected by a <strong>Jutsu</strong> which can only be opened by a password found inside the leaf village. But the problem is that Orochimaru is controlling the village at this stage, so you cannot go inside, but you suddenly remember that the guards at the gates are prime number lovers. They have a secret technique that prime numbers can unlock. They want to betray Orochimaru and rule the village hidden in the leaves by themselves. However, they both are dumb, so you came up with a plan.</p>

<p>You will help those guards with prime numbers in order to let you go inside the village and take the password. Also, once they know the technique, they will keep Orochimaru and his army busy.</p>

<p>The way to unlock their hidden Jutsu is to give them all the prime numbers between two integers.</p></div></div></div><div class="challenge_input_format"><div class="msB challenge_input_format_title"><p><strong>Input Format</strong></p></div><div class="msB challenge_input_format_body"><div class="hackdown-content"><ul>
