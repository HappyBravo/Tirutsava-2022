# Tirutsava-2022

Competitive Programming (CP) is now being considered an e-sport, a mind game. CP is basically solving algorithmic problems by writing programs. A CP contest is an event where participants are expected to solve ( write a program that generates the desired output) a few algorithmic problems given the time constraints. The Ranks are then calculated based on the time (actual time for a correct submission + time penalty for each wrong submission). All of this frequently happens on Codeforces, Codechef, Atcoder to name a few. A CP contest helps you improve your coding skills and give you an edge in other coding-related events.
